# Shorten URL
The "Shorten URL" app is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to make your long URLs more concise and manageable. With just a few clicks, you can create shortened versions of lengthy links, making them easier to share, remember, and distribute.

## How It Works
#### 1. URL Shortening:
  The app takes a long URL as input and generates a unique, shortened version of the link. This process makes the URL more concise, typically reducing its length significantly.

#### 2. Copy to Clipboard:
  Once the shortened URL is generated, users can easily copy it to their clipboard with a single click. This allows for quick and hassle-free sharing of the shortened link through various communication channels, such as emails, social media, or messaging apps.

#### 3. Redirects:
  When someone clicks on the shortened link, the app efficiently redirects them to the original, longer URL associated with it. Users can be confident that their audience will be directed to the intended destination.
